# Chess

My goal is to make a chess game in cpp.

after this task done , i would like to make a different bot ,

a classic minmax algoritm with some heuristic compute
with the position of each piece

next a RN full-connected,
mostly 64-40-20-10-1

input: board -> output: -1 < heuristic < 1

training genetic


the final goal is to produce a trained RN

that use both of the board and the minmax to play as accurate
as possible


run :  make -B && ./chess

current output:

lets go
|r||k||b||q||k||b||c||r|
|p||p||p||p||p||p||p||p|
| || || || || || || || |
| || || || || || || || |
| || || || || || || || |
| || || || || || || || |
|P||P||P||P||P||P||P||P|
|R||K||B||Q||K||B||C||R|
