# Chess

My goal is to make a chess game in cpp.

after this task done , i would like to make a bot ,

-A classic minmax algoritm with a classic heuristic

-next a RN full-connected,
mostly 64-40-20-10-1
    input: board , heuristic
    output: -1 < heuristic < 1

run :  make -B && ./chess

playble like the wood version and more,

check if the king in check and see wich moves are legal

check about stalemate and checkmate ,

add about pawns promote

add roc (O-O and O-O-O) little roc seems fine

after that it should nice for a bot!
