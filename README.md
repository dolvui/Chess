# Chess

My goal is to make a chess game in cpp.

after this task done , i would like to make a different bot ,

a classic minmax algoritm with some heuristic compute
with the position of each piece

next a RN full-connected,
mostly 64-40-20-10-1

input: board -> output: -1 < heuristic < 1

training genetic


the final goal is to produce a trained RN

that use both of the board and the minmax to play as accurate
as possible
